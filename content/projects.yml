    From 2018–⁠2019 I was leading the design and development of the Commons marketplace, a Web3 data marketplace to explore, download, and publish open data sets registered in the [Ocean Protocol](/oceanprotocol) network.

    As the main frontfacing UI of Ocean Protocol, it serves as a product and showcase bringing together the complete Ocean Protocol stack in a simple interface. Additionally, the project was created with developers in mind, making Commons the most complete boilerplate for creating dApps on top of Ocean Protocol.

    Since 2017 I'm leading the UI design & development of Ocean Protocol, iterating on a components-based UI design system spanning all of Ocean Protocol's web properties. Additionally, I conceptualize, execute and iterate on the creative and visual direction of the Ocean Protocol brand.

    Most web interfaces are single-page JavaScript applications built with React, pulling their data from JSON files and various micro services. All design & development is embedded in continuous deployment processes via GitHub, Travis, Kubernetes, and Now.

    From 2015–2017 I was leading the UI design & development of all IPDB web properties and additionally iterated on the creative and visual direction of the IPDB brand.

    The main website is a static site built with Jekyll and a custom Gulp-based build pipeline in front of it. All design & development is embedded in a continuous deployment process via GitHub & Travis.

    From 2016–2019 I was leading the UI design & development of all BigchainDB web properties. I created the initial BigchainDB brand and further conceptualized, executed and iterated on the creative and visual direction of BigchainDB. This included creating and iterating on a components-based UI design system for all of BigchainDB's web properties.

    The main website is a static site built with Jekyll and a custom Gulp-based build pipeline in front of it, pulling data from various external sources and microservices. All design & development is embedded in a continuous deployment process via GitHub & Travis.
