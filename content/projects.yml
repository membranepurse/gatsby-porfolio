    After receiving my Health IT certificate from McCombs, I was lucky enough to get the opportunity to build a dashboard for community hospitals in Texas with TORCH. 
    
    The dashboard allows authorized users to share and compare stats such as average length of stay in compliance with HIPAA regulations.

    Since 2017 I'm leading the UI design & development of Ocean Protocol, iterating on a components-based UI design system spanning all of Ocean Protocol's web properties. Additionally, I conceptualize, execute and iterate on the creative and visual direction of the Ocean Protocol brand.

    Most web interfaces are single-page JavaScript applications built with React, pulling their data from JSON files and various micro services. All design & development is embedded in continuous deployment processes via GitHub, Travis, Kubernetes, and Now.

    Initial website in collaboration with [Balance](https://balance.io/). Key visuals in collaboration with [Wojciech Hupert](https://twitter.com/wojciechhupert).
